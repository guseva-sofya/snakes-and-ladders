# Snakes and Ladders
## Introduction 
Implement a game - Snakes and Ladders - where we need to find 
the minimum number of turns to end the game getting from the square 1 to square 100.
On each turn players will roll a six-sided die and move forward 
a number of spaces equal to the result. If they land on a square that 
represents a snake or ladder, they will be transported ahead or behind, 
respectively, to a new square.
